## Introduction
This project analyzes Uber's public dataset using cloud and data analytics tools to uncover patterns and trends that support strategic decision-making.

## Objective
Utilize Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Python, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio to extract insights from Uber's NYC pickup data, focusing on trends and patterns for optimization.

## Data Overview
The dataset includes millions of Uber pickups in NYC, detailing variables such as date, time, and location. These data points help reveal patterns in ride demand.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Infrastructure and storage
- **Python**: Data processing and analysis
- **Mage Data Pipeline Tool**: ETL processes
- **BigQuery**: Data storage and querying
- **Looker Studio**: Interactive dashboards and visualizations

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Modeling**: Design schema for efficient querying.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Load dataset into Google Cloud Storage.
3. **ETL Pipeline**: Use Mage for data extraction, transformation, and loading into BigQuery.
4. **Data Cleansing**: Handle missing data, duplicates, and standardization in BigQuery.
5. **Data Visualization**: Create dashboards in Looker Studio to display insights.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarize insights, discuss potential for adding external data sources and predictive modeling for deeper analysis.
